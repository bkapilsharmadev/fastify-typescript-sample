How to Split Large Commits
Splitting large commits into smaller, logical ones improves readability, debugging, and reviewability. Here's how you can split a large commit:

Scenario: You've already made a large commit and want to split it.
1. Check the Commit History
Use git log to find the large commit:
bash
Copy code
git log
Identify the commit hash of the large commit you want to split.
2. Reset the Commit
Use git reset to undo the large commit while keeping your changes in the working directory:
bash
Copy code
git reset HEAD~1
This will:
Undo the last commit.
Leave the changes in your working directory (unstaged).
3. Stage Changes in Chunks
Use git add -p to stage parts of the changes interactively:
bash
Copy code
git add -p
Git will show chunks of changes and ask you what to do:
y: Stage this chunk.
n: Don’t stage this chunk.
s: Split this chunk further.
q: Quit.
4. Create Smaller Commits
Once you've staged the first chunk, commit it with a meaningful message:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Commit message for first chunk"
Repeat the process (git add -p and git commit) for each logical chunk of changes.
5. Verify Commit History
Check your new, smaller commits using:
bash
Copy code
git log
Splitting Commits During an Interactive Rebase
If the large commit is not the latest one in your branch, you can split it during a rebase:

1. Start an Interactive Rebase
Start rebasing from a parent commit before the large one:
bash
Copy code
git rebase -i <commit-hash-before-large-commit>
2. Mark the Commit for Editing
In the rebase editor, change the word pick to edit next to the large commit.
3. Split the Commit
After the rebase stops, use git reset to unstage the changes:
bash
Copy code
git reset HEAD
Stage and commit the changes in smaller chunks (as described above).
4. Continue the Rebase
Once you've created the smaller commits, continue the rebase:
bash
Copy code
git rebase --continue
What Is git bisect?
git bisect is a Git command used to find the specific commit that introduced a bug or issue in your code. It works by performing a binary search through your commit history.

How Does git bisect Work?
Start Bisecting:

Start git bisect with the first bad commit (where the bug exists) and a known good commit (where the code works correctly):
bash
Copy code
git bisect start
git bisect bad <commit-hash-with-bug>
git bisect good <commit-hash-without-bug>
Test Commits:

Git will check out the midpoint between the good and bad commits.
Test this version and tell Git whether it’s good or bad:
If the current version works:
bash
Copy code
git bisect good
If the current version has the bug:
bash
Copy code
git bisect bad
Repeat Until Found:

Git will narrow down the search, checking out the middle of the remaining commits each time, until it identifies the exact commit that introduced the issue.
Finish Bisecting:

Once the commit is found, exit bisect mode:
bash
Copy code
git bisect reset
Why Use git bisect?
Efficient Debugging: It’s faster than manually searching through commits, especially in large projects.
Isolate Issues: Pinpoints the exact commit where a bug was introduced.
Works with Automated Tests: You can script the process if you have tests to determine good/bad states.
When to Use Each
Splitting Large Commits:
Use when a single commit contains multiple unrelated changes or is too large to review easily.
Using git bisect:
Use when you need to find which commit introduced a bug in the codebase.

You should run lint-staged before the large commit check to ensure the staged files are properly linted and formatted before checking the size of the commit. This way, you enforce code quality and style consistency before determining whether the commit is too large.

Reasoning
Why Before?

lint-staged ensures all staged files meet your linting and formatting requirements.
Any changes made by lint-staged (e.g., fixing formatting issues) will be included in the size calculation for the commit.
Prevents scenarios where a linting error might block the commit later, forcing you to re-stage files and repeat the size check.
Why Not After?

If the size check blocks the commit first, you’ll never reach the linting stage, meaning code quality could be skipped entirely.
Modified Script
Here’s how the pre-commit hook script should look with lint-staged integrated:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/sh
# Run lint-staged to ensure staged files are linted and formatted
npx lint-staged
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Commit rejected: Linting or formatting failed."
    exit 1
fi

# Check for large commits
MAX_LINES=300
ADDED_LINES=$(git diff --cached --numstat | awk '{added += $1} END {print added}')

if [ "$ADDED_LINES" -gt "$MAX_LINES" ]; then
    echo "Commit rejected: $ADDED_LINES lines added (limit is $MAX_LINES). Please split your changes into smaller commits."
    exit 1
fi
Workflow
Step 1: Run lint-staged:

Fixes or identifies linting and formatting issues in staged files.
Prevents committing unformatted or low-quality code.
Step 2: Check Commit Size:

After ensuring code quality, checks if the commit size exceeds the MAX_LINES threshold.
If it does, the commit is rejected with a message to split the changes.
Benefits of This Order
Ensures code quality before size enforcement.
Accounts for additional changes made by lint-staged during the size calculation.
Encourages developers to maintain clean and focused commits.

Splitting large commits into smaller, logical ones improves readability, debugging, and reviewability. Here's how you can split a large commit:

Scenario: You've already made a large commit and want to split it.
1. Check the Commit History
Use git log to find the large commit:
bash
Copy code
git log
Identify the commit hash of the large commit you want to split.
2. Reset the Commit
Use git reset to undo the large commit while keeping your changes in the working directory:
bash
Copy code
git reset HEAD~1
This will:
Undo the last commit.
Leave the changes in your working directory (unstaged).
3. Stage Changes in Chunks
Use git add -p to stage parts of the changes interactively:
bash
Copy code
git add -p
Git will show chunks of changes and ask you what to do:
y: Stage this chunk.
n: Don’t stage this chunk.
s: Split this chunk further.
q: Quit.
4. Create Smaller Commits
Once you've staged the first chunk, commit it with a meaningful message:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Commit message for first chunk"
Repeat the process (git add -p and git commit) for each logical chunk of changes.
5. Verify Commit History
Check your new, smaller commits using:
bash
Copy code
git log
Splitting Commits During an Interactive Rebase
If the large commit is not the latest one in your branch, you can split it during a rebase:

1. Start an Interactive Rebase
Start rebasing from a parent commit before the large one:
bash
Copy code
git rebase -i <commit-hash-before-large-commit>
2. Mark the Commit for Editing
In the rebase editor, change the word pick to edit next to the large commit.
3. Split the Commit
After the rebase stops, use git reset to unstage the changes:
bash
Copy code
git reset HEAD
Stage and commit the changes in smaller chunks (as described above).
4. Continue the Rebase
Once you've created the smaller commits, continue the rebase:
bash
Copy code
git rebase --continue
What Is git bisect?
git bisect is a Git command used to find the specific commit that introduced a bug or issue in your code. It works by performing a binary search through your commit history.

How Does git bisect Work?
Start Bisecting:

Start git bisect with the first bad commit (where the bug exists) and a known good commit (where the code works correctly):
bash
Copy code
git bisect start
git bisect bad <commit-hash-with-bug>
git bisect good <commit-hash-without-bug>
Test Commits:

Git will check out the midpoint between the good and bad commits.
Test this version and tell Git whether it’s good or bad:
If the current version works:
bash
Copy code
git bisect good
If the current version has the bug:
bash
Copy code
git bisect bad
Repeat Until Found:

Git will narrow down the search, checking out the middle of the remaining commits each time, until it identifies the exact commit that introduced the issue.
Finish Bisecting:

Once the commit is found, exit bisect mode:
bash
Copy code
git bisect reset
Why Use git bisect?
Efficient Debugging: It’s faster than manually searching through commits, especially in large projects.
Isolate Issues: Pinpoints the exact commit where a bug was introduced.
Works with Automated Tests: You can script the process if you have tests to determine good/bad states.
When to Use Each
Splitting Large Commits:
Use when a single commit contains multiple unrelated changes or is too large to review easily.
Using git bisect:
Use when you need to find which commit introduced a bug in the codebase.

You should run lint-staged before the large commit check to ensure the staged files are properly linted and formatted before checking the size of the commit. This way, you enforce code quality and style consistency before determining whether the commit is too large.

Reasoning
Why Before?

lint-staged ensures all staged files meet your linting and formatting requirements.
Any changes made by lint-staged (e.g., fixing formatting issues) will be included in the size calculation for the commit.
Prevents scenarios where a linting error might block the commit later, forcing you to re-stage files and repeat the size check.
Why Not After?

If the size check blocks the commit first, you’ll never reach the linting stage, meaning code quality could be skipped entirely.
Modified Script
Here’s how the pre-commit hook script should look with lint-staged integrated:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/sh
# Run lint-staged to ensure staged files are linted and formatted
npx lint-staged
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Commit rejected: Linting or formatting failed."
    exit 1
fi

# Check for large commits
MAX_LINES=300
ADDED_LINES=$(git diff --cached --numstat | awk '{added += $1} END {print added}')

if [ "$ADDED_LINES" -gt "$MAX_LINES" ]; then
    echo "Commit rejected: $ADDED_LINES lines added (limit is $MAX_LINES). Please split your changes into smaller commits."
    exit 1
fi
Workflow
Step 1: Run lint-staged:

Fixes or identifies linting and formatting issues in staged files.
Prevents committing unformatted or low-quality code.
Step 2: Check Commit Size:

After ensuring code quality, checks if the commit size exceeds the MAX_LINES threshold.
If it does, the commit is rejected with a message to split the changes.
Benefits of This Order
Ensures code quality before size enforcement.
Accounts for additional changes made by lint-staged during the size calculation.
Encourages developers to maintain clean and focused commits.
